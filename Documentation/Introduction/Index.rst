Introduction
============

What does it do?
----------------

This is a TYPO3 plugin that provides bookmarks functionality of local pages for logged in frontend users.
For example this is very helpful for intranet websites.

TypoScript and fluid templates are just examples. Adapt it to your needs.

In the example templates there's nothing shown if the user is not logged in.


Screenshots
-----------


.. figure:: ../Images/screenshot-styled-fe.png

    The screenshot shows the functionality, the styling is not included.


You have a list with bookmarks which can be deleted and you can place a 'bookmark' button anywhere on the page.
